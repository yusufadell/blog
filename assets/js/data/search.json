All that matters is that they’repositioned first in the parameter list for that particular method.obj = MyClass()print(obj.method())without the syntactic sugar provided by the obj.method() dot-call syntaxprint(same as MyClass.method(obj))print(obj.classmethod())This confirms that static methods can neither access the object in-stance state nor the class state. They work like regular functions but belong to the class’(and every instance’s) namespace.print(obj.staticmethod())Flagging a method as a static method is not just a hint that a methodwon’t modify class or instance state. As you’ve seen this restriction isalso enforced by the Python runtime.Key Takeaways Instance methods need a class instance and can access the instance through self. Class methods don’t need a class instance. They can’t access theinstance (self) but they have access to the class itself via cls. Static methods don’t have access to cls or self. They work likeregular functions but belong to the class’ namespace. Static and class methods communicate and (to a certain degree)enforce developer intent about class design.

It lets you create child classes thatinherit the methods of their parent classes. You can override the methodsto provide new code for them but also use the super() function to call theoriginal methods in the parent class. A child class has an “is a” relationshipwith its parent class, because an object of the child class is a kind of objectof the parent class.In Python, using classes and inheritance is optional. Some program-mers see the complexity that heavy use of inheritance creates as not worthits benefits. It’s often more flexible to use composition instead of inheri-tance, because it implements a “has a” relationship with an object of oneclass and objects of other classes rather than inheriting methods directlyfrom those other classes. This means that objects of one class can have anobject of another class. For example, a Customer object could have a birthdatemethod that is assigned a Date object rather than the Customer class subclass-ing Date.Just as type() can return the type of the object passed to it, the i­ sinstance()and issubclass() functions return type and inheritance information aboutthe object passed to them.Classes can have object methods and attributes, but they can also haveclass methods, class attributes, and static methods. Although these arerarely used, they can enable other object-oriented techniques that globalvariables and functions can’t provide.Python lets classes inherit from multiple parents, although this can leadto code that is difficult to understand. The super() function and a class’smethods figure out how to inherit methods based on the MRO. You canview a class’s MRO in the interactive shell by calling the mro() method onthe class.This chapter and the previous one covered general OOP concepts. Inthe next chapter, we’ll explore Python-specific OOP techniques." }, { "title": "Why not to use Inheritance", "url": "/posts/Why-not-to-use-inthereiance/", "categories": "Programming", "tags": "python, programming", "date": "2022-01-31 00:00:00 +0200", "snippet": "It’s easy to overengineer your classes using inheritance. As LucianoRamalho states, “Placing objects in a neat hierarchy appeals to our senseof order; programmers do it just for fun.” We’ll create classes, subclasses,and sub-subclasses when a single class, or a couple of functions in a mod-ule, would achieve the same effect. But recall the Zen of Python tenet inChapter 6 that simple is better than complex.Using OOP allows you to organize your code into smaller units (in thiscase, classes) that are easier to reason about than one large .py file with hun-dreds of functions defined in no particular order. Inheritance is useful ifyou have several functions that all operate on the same dictionary or listdata structure. In that case, it’s beneficial to organize them into a class.But here are some examples of when you don’t need to create a class oruse inheritance: If your class consists of methods that never use the self or cls param-eter, delete the class and use functions in place of the methods.• If you’ve created a parent with only a single child class but never createobjects of the parent class, you can combine them into a single class. If you create more than three or four levels of subclasses, you’re prob-ably using inheritance unnecessarily. Combine those subclasses intofewer classes. As the non-OOP and OOP versions of the tic-tac-toe program in theprevious chapter illustrate, it’s certainly possible to not use classes and stillhave a working, bug-free program. Don’t feel that you have to design yourprogram as some complex web of classes. A simple solution that works is bet-ter than a complicated solution that doesn’t. Joel Spolsky writes about this inhis blog post, “Don’t Let the Astronaut Architects Scare You” at https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2001/04/21/dont-let-architecture-astronauts-scare-you/.You should know how object-oriented concepts like inheritance work,because they can help you organize your code and make development anddebugging easier.

Along with these two original decorators,Python now provides a few right out of the box and supports the simple creation of custom decorators.But it seems as though most developers do not understand how they work behind the scenes.we’ll look at using decorators to create static, class, and abstract methodsand take a close look at the super() function, which allows you to place implementablecode inside an abstract method.Decorators and When to Use ThemA decorator is a function that takes another function as an argument andreplaces it with a new, modified function. The primary use case for decorators is in factoring common codethat needs to be called before, after, or around multiple functions. If you’ve ever written Emacs Lisp code,you may have used the defadvice decorator, which allows you to define code calledaround a function. If you’ve used method combinations in the CommonLisp Object System (CLOS), Python decorators follow the same concepts.We’ll look at some simple decorator definitions, and then we’ll examinesome common situations in which you’d use decorators.Creating DecoratorsThe odds are good that you’ve already used decorators to make your ownwrapper functions. The dullest possible decorator, and the simplest example,is the identity() function, which does nothing except return the originalfunction. Here is its definition:def identity(f): return fYou would then use your decorator like this:@identitydef foo(): return &#39;bar&#39;You enter the name of the decorator preceded by an @ symbol and thenenter the function you want to use it on. This is the same as writing thefollowing:def foo(): return &#39;bar&#39;foo = identity(foo)This decorator is useless, but it works. Let’s look at another, more useful_functions = {}def register(f): global _functions _functions[f.__name__] = f return f@registerdef foo(): return &#39;bar&#39;the register decorator stores the decorated functionname into a dictionary. The _functions dictionary can then be used andaccessed using the function name to retrieve a function: _functions[&#39;foo&#39;]points to the foo() function.In the following Post, I will explain how to write your own decora tors.Then I’ll cover how the built-in decorators provided by Python workand explain how (and when) to use them." }, { "title": "When you don&#39;t know what you don&#39;t know!", "url": "/posts/When-you-don-t-know-what-you-don-t-know/", "categories": "Programming", "tags": "programming, tutorial", "date": "2022-01-17 00:00:00 +0200", "snippet": "There’s a certain class of problems that kind of fascinates me and I’d describe them as not knowing what you don’t know.

You could say it’s involuntary ignorance or unawareness of common knowledge. It’s something that you don’t know, that everybody else seems to know, and because everybody else seems to know it they assume you couldn’t possibly not know it. If I had to list the features of the problem it’d look like this: Very hard to discover the solution Once you discover the solution, fixing the problem is usually trivial The solutions are always obvious in retrospect The solutions are already widely known by othersI have several examples of this happening in my life. The first and best example is when I was 10. In school I was failing history tests but doing well on every other subject. A poor grade would be something like &amp;lt; 75/100. I was getting scores in the 20s/100. Basically bottom 1st percentile stuff. The school was calling my parents, suggesting maybe I should be moved to a different school. The school and my parents IQ tested me three times. I underwent a battery of tests, such as neurological, vision, hearing, psychological, etc.Apparently many thousands of dollars were spent trying to find the underlying problem. The solution came from a child psychologist who figured out that I didn’t understand the concept of studying. I didn’t know I could or was supposed to prepare for these tests by repeatedly reviewing the material so I would memorize it. Nobody had told me about it and I had never done it before. I guess the subject never came up in conversations with friends, or if it did maybe I thought studying meant something different. I really have no idea how other people figured this out on their own. Naturally the solution was to get a tutor and my next score on these tests was 96/100. This issue was immediately resolved and never happened again.A more relatable and general example is someone who mispronounces words because he learned it on his own by reading.There’s really no doubt that this kind of problem must be generally pervasive in every functional area of life. Social, academic, professional, health, romantic, etc. For some people, the difference in between success and mediocrity may come down to unawareness of some common knowledge that plays an important functional role.I don’t really have firm recommendations on detecting of fixing these sorts of problems. The most I can say is that in my experience the people most likely to point out these common-sense solutions are either mentors, trusted friends, or hired consultants. They will generally provide you honest feedback that others wouldn’t for risk of offending you." }, { "title": "How to Learn Any Programming Language?", "url": "/posts/How-to-learn-anyprogramming-language/", "categories": "Programming", "tags": "programming, tutorial", "date": "2022-01-10 00:00:00 +0200", "snippet": "How to Learn Any Programming LanguageI’m going to teach you how to learn most of the programming languages you may want to learn inthe future. This is based on how I and many other programmers learn newlanguages. The process that I usually follow is as follows: Get a book or some introductory text about the language. Go through the book and type in all of the code, making all of it run. Read the book as you work on the code, taking notes. Use the language to implement a small set of programs you are familiar with in another language. Read other people’s code in the language, and try to copy their patterns. In this book, I forced you to go through this process very slowly and in small chunks. Other books aren’torganized the same way, and this means you have to extrapolate how I’ve made you do this to how theircontent is organized. The best way to do this is to read the book lightly and make a list of all the majorcode sections. Turn this list into a set of exercises based on the chapters, and then simply do them inorder one at a time.The preceding process also works for new technologies, assuming they have books you can read. Foranything without books, you do the above process but use online documentation or source code as yourinitial introduction.Each new language you learn makes you a better programmer, and as you learn more languages theybecome easier to learn. By your third or fourth language you should be able to pick up similar languagesin a week, with stranger languages taking longer. Now that you know Python you could potentially learnRuby and JavaScript fairly quickly by comparison. This is simply because many languages share similarconcepts, and once you learn the concepts in one language they work in others.The ﬁnal thing to remember about learning a new language is this: Don’t be a stupid tourist. A stupidtourist is someone who goes to another country and then complains that the food isn’t like the food athome (“Why can’t I get a good burger in this stupid country?!”). When you’re learning a new language,assume that what it does isn’t stupid, it’s just diﬀerent, and embrace it so you can learn it.After you learn a language, though, don’t be a slave to that language’s way of doing things. Sometimesthe people who use a language actually do some very idiotic things for no other reason than “that’s howwe’ve always done it.” If you like your style better and you know how everyone else does it, then feel freeto break their rules if it improves things.I really enjoy learning new programming languages. I think of myself as a “programmer anthropologist”and think of languages as little insights about the group of programmers who use them. I’m learning alanguage they all use to talk to each other through computers, and I ﬁnd this fascinating. Then again,I’m kind of a weird guy, so just learn programming languages because you want to.Enjoy!This is really fun stuﬀ." }, { "title": "Open Source is Not About You", "url": "/posts/OpenSource-Is-Not-About-You/", "categories": "Tutorial", "tags": "open-source", "date": "2022-01-03 00:00:00 +0200", "snippet": "Open Source is Not About YouThe only people entitled to say how open source ‘ought’ to work are people who run projects, and thescope of their entitlement extends only to their own projects.Just because someone open sources something does not imply they owe the world a change in their status,focus and eﬀort, e.g. from inventor to community manager.As a user of something open source you are not thereby entitled to anything at all.

If you want things, make them.Open source is a licensing and delivery mechanism, period. It means you get the source for software andthe right to use and modify it. All social impositions associated with it, including the idea of ‘community-driven-development’ are part of a recently-invented mythology with little basis in how things actually work,a mythology that embodies, cult-like, both a lack of support for diversity in the ways things can work and apervasive sense of communal entitlement.If you think Cognitect is not doing anything for the community, or is not listening to the community, you aresimply wrong. You are not, however, entitled to it being the eﬀort, focus or response you desire. We get tomake our own choices as regards our time and lives.We at Cognitect have to show up to work, every day, to make a living. We get no royalties of any kind fromClojure. We are in no way building Clojure for proﬁt. Far fewer than 1% of Clojure users are our consultingor product customers, and thus contributing to our livelihood.We take some of what we earn, money that could e.g. go into our retirement savings and instead use it tohire people to work on Clojure and community outreach, some full-time. To be honest, I could use thatmoney in my retirement account, having depleted it to make Clojure in the ﬁrst place. But I love workingwith the team on Clojure, and am proud of the work we do.Alex Miller is extremely attentive to and engaged with the Clojure community. He and Stu Halloway and Iregularly meet and discuss community issues. Alex, at my direction, spends the majority of his time eitherworking on features for the community or assessing patches and bug reports. I spend signiﬁcant portionsof my time designing these features - spec, tools.deps, error handling and more to come. This is time takenaway from earning a living.I am grateful for the contributions of the community. Every Clojure release incorporates manycontributions. The vast majority of the user community doesn’t contribute, and doesn’t desire tocontribute. And that’s ﬁne. Open source is a no-strings-attached gift, and all participants should recognizeit as such.The Clojure process is not closed, but it is conservative. I think Clojure beneﬁts greatly from thatconservatism, in contrast to some other projects with high churn rates and feature bloat. If you disagree orimagine otherwise, that’s too bad. It’s my life and I’m not going to spend it arguing/negotiating on/with theinternet.

Did you know that most patches/issues have poor problem statements, nodescription of the plan (read my code!), no consideration of alternatives, no tests, no designs, and are ill-conceived and/or broken in some way?

In fact,in most cases we can’t even create an effective proposal until we know those things.Below are eleven questions you should ask your prospective clients before you get started on their project.They’re aimed at uncovering the root of what the project will entailwithout requiring client to spend an entire workday answering questions.1. Why do you want a website (or have your current site redesigned)?It’s important to get an understanding of why your prospective new client wants a website. Some businesses have unrealistic goals, expecting a new website to magically fix a failing business or to triple their sales. Other clients might just want a website because they think everyone else in their industry has one (which may or may not be true). If you know your client’s motivation for wanting a website, you can better guide them in what they should include in their site and how to best position it. This is a question a lot of designers fail to ask, and because of that they often can’t offer their clients the best solutions, because they have no idea what their client really wants. Clients are notoriously bad about communicating what it is they really want. They might spend some time look at websites from their competition and then decide that’s what they need without having any idea why their competitors might have done something in particular. They also often overlook things that could make their website better than their competitor’s, because they’re looking at things in terms of features, rather than benefits. It’s your job as a designer to get them thinking about benefits to their visitors rather than bells and whistles.2. What’s your business/organization all about?It’s important to know what a business does before you start designing a website for them. But it’s also important to know a bit about their philosophy and how they want to come across. You want to know as much about what their business does and how they do it before you start thinking about designs. This question might need some follow up to really get to the heart of what their business is about. Ask them about their philosophy, about what they want their customers to think about them, and what their long-term goals are. Even asking about things like charitable contributions or community involvement can shed light on the image a company wants to portray.3. What sets your business apart from your competition?Finding out how a business differs from others in their industry gives insight into what they feel is important. You don’t just want to know how they’re different when you ask this question. You want to know where they emphasize they’re different. This tells you what that company values, and what they think their customers value. This is also a great source for finding out what kind of content they should have on their site. If they stress how long they’ve been in business compared to their competition, you’ll want to make sure that’s included prominently on their home page or in their header. It should also be reflected in the design itself. If a company stresses being more cutting-edge than their competition, they’ll likely want their website to reflect that.4. What problems does your business solve?This question is about getting your client to think in terms of benefits rather than just features. You want them to focus on what their business actually does, rather than just the features or services they provide. Clients and visitors care about what a company or website can do for them, not necessarily how they do it. For example, when someone visits the website of an accountant, they’re not looking for an accountant. They’re looking for someone who can help them better manage their money. They’re looking for someone who can save them money on their taxes or other expenses. The end result is what’s important to them, not how they get there. The same goes for online apps. People don’t care as much about features as they do what those features can do for them. You need to find out from your client what all those features mean for their visitors and customers.5. Who are your prospective customers or visitors?A website designed to appeal to 30-something professionals is going to be different than one aimed at young newlyweds or retirees. It’s important that you have a good grasp on who your client’s customers are. It affects not only the look and feel of the site, but may also affect usability and accessibility issues.6. What do you want visitors to do on your site?Different websites have different goals. Some sites are there to encourage visitors to purchase something. Others are there to provide information. Still others are there to get someone to request more information or sign up for a free trial. Before you can create an effective website, you need to know what your client wants visitors to do on their site. The site architecture for an informational site is very different than the architecture for a site that wants people to buy something. While you may have a good idea of what your client wants their visitors to do, it’s still a good idea to clarify things with them before you start on their project7.What is your budget?The reason behind this question is two-fold. First, you want to know how much money they’ve put aside for their website. Some businesses have no idea how much a website generally costs, so you may need to guide them by giving them some examples. Don’t automatically discredit someone who doesn’t yet have a budget in mind, as long as they’re willing to talk frankly about money with you prior to receiving a proposal. That’s the other reason behind the money question. If a client isn’t willing to talk honestly about money, what makes you think they’ll be upfront about other things throughout the design process? You want a client who can communicate effectively with you. One who can’t discuss money is likely to have issues discussing other things, which can lead to frustration for both of you.8. By what date do you need the site completed?A lot of people aren’t very realistic about how much time a website takes to complete. Usually, it’s because they don’t understand how much work a website takes to design and code. They look at a site and think in only the most basic terms of what it does, thinking it can’t be that difficult if they only had the right tools. A lot of non-designers have the misconception that the software does all the work, and the designer does little more than push a few buttons. By finding out what your client expects in terms of schedule up front, you can avoid confusion later. If you’re lucky, your client will have reasonable expectations when it comes to time. If not, then it’s easier to get them to adjust their expectations at the beginning than it is when you’ve already started working on their site.9. What are your long-term plans for your site?A lot of clients might come to you and say they just want a simple website with a few pages about their products and some photos. They don’t have a big budget and they want something done relatively quickly. And they tell you they’ll just have you make updates to the site, rather than doing it themselves.What they don’t tell you is that they want to set up a full e-commerce site next year when they release some new products. They don’t tell you they want a social network for their clients, or a bunch of employee blogs for outreach and marketing purposes. And, unfortunately, their entire site will have to be rebuilt from scratch when they decide to go ahead with any of their plans. If you know what they want to do in the future with their site, you can make allowances in the design and coding now. If you know they’re going to want to do all these things in the next year or two, you can be sure to use a CMS that can expand to accommodate their future plans. It saves them time and money in the future, and makes them happier with you, since you were looking out for their interests.10. Who will be responsible for updating your site??This is another important question to ask up front, as it can play a large part in determining what CMS you use. You also want to ask how tech-savvy the person responsible for updates is, and possibly meet with them before you start designing, to get a real feel for what they’re comfortable with. The client may say they want you to do updates, and if that’s the case you’ll want to include a maintenance agreement in your contract. Make sure your client knows your policy about how many hours you include in your maintenance plan each month and whether you’re willing to carry over unused time. If you don’t specify, your client may expect that (we have rollover minutes on cell phone plans to thank for that).11. What do you NOT want on your website?People can often nail down what they don’t like much easier than what they do. Ask someone what their favorite food is and it might take them a while to think about it, or they might give you a bunch of answers, unable to decide. But ask them what food they hate most, and they can usually tell you without having to consider it. To get a clearer picture of what your client wants on their site, get to the root of what they don’t want. This is especially helpful when you have a client who uses the infamous “I’ll know what I want when I see it” line, as you can at least rule out what they don’t want. Sometimes this question ends up revealing what they really do want, too, as they’ll often make comparisons between what they don’t like and a better alternative." }, { "title": "15 Web Developer Interview Questions", "url": "/posts/15-Web-developer-interview-questions/", "categories": "Web development", "tags": "web, interview", "date": "2021-12-20 00:00:00 +0200", "snippet": "Advanced Interview QuestionsThe following Blog will cover the senior web developer interview questions but I suggest you go through them even if you are a fresher or an intermediate web developer candidateWhat are the types of popup boxes present in JavaScript?0- What are the types of popup boxes present in JavaScript?There are three types of dialog boxes, which are used in JavaScript: type usage alert Presents users with a message and an OK button Confirm Gives the users a window with OK and Cancel buttons Prompt Shows the user input, alongside OK and Cancel buttons 1- There are three types of dialog boxes, which are used in JavaScriptThe &amp;lt;window.onload&amp;gt; event is not called until a page is completely loaded with the entire styling from CSS and images. The event does add a bit of delay when rendering a web page.With the &amp;lt;onDocumentReady&amp;gt; event, it will wait only till the DOM is initialized and will begin the event action. This ensures to reduce any delays in actions.2- How is type conversion handled in JavaScript? JavaScript supports automatic type conversion. Since it is weakly typed, you can pass a function as an argument into another function easily. This ensures that there are no errors or data type-associated warnings as values get converted to the required data type automatically. 3- What is the meaning of the scope of a variable in JavaScript?Scope refers to the accessibility of functions and underlying variables in the running environment. There are two scopes supported in JavaScript: Local scope: Here, values and functions declared inside the same function function can only be accessed within that function and not outside it. Consider the following example: // Code present here cannot use localVariablefunction myFunction() { var localVariable = &quot;This is a local variable&quot;; // Code present here can use localVariable} Global scope: If a variable is declared as global, it can be accessed from anywhere in the application. Consider the following example: var globalVariable = &quot;This is a Global variable&quot;;// Code present here can use globalVariablefunction myFunction() { // Code present here can also use globalVariable}4- How are comments used in JavaScript?JavaScript supports two types of comment insertion in the code. Single-line comments and multi-line comments.Single-line comment: “//” is used for single-line comment insertionExample://This is a single-line commentMulti-line comment: `/**/” is used to add multi-line commentsExample:/* Thisis amulti-linecomment*/Coming to the next set of interview questions for web developers, here is a common question for JavaScript.5- What are undefined and undeclared variables in JavaScript? Variables that have been declared already but not initialized are known as undefined variables. On the other hand, if a variable is being used in a program without being declared, then it is considered as an undeclared variable.Consider the following example:var undefVar;alert(undefVar); // undefined variablealert(notDeclared); // accessing an undeclared variable6- What is the method used to submit forms in JavaScript?Forms can be submitted easily in JavaScript by calling the following method:document.forms[0].submit();Here, Zero 0 denotes the index of the form.7- Why is keyword used a lot in JavaScript?The &amp;lt;this&amp;gt; keyword is used to access the current object present in a program. This object resides inside a method, and the keyword is used for referencing the corresponding variable or object.8- What is the use of the ‘defer’ attribute in JavaScript?The attribute is used as a boolean type attribute. It is used to delay the execution of the JavaScript code on a web page until the parser completely loads and initializes the page.Example:&amp;lt;script src=&quot;/example.js&quot; defer&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;9- How can you prioritize SEO, maintainability, performance, and security in a web application?This is a commonly asked question in a Web Development interview.
