    GitHub is not only a great place to store and share your code with others
    but they also offer free web hosting of your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript projects!

**follow these 8 easy steps**
Firstly you should

## Create a GitHub account on github.com

after that you have 2 choices.
create a repository from the website then chose **setup on desktop**

OR

## download  desktop version

windows and mac >> [this website](https://desktop.github.com/)

for [ubuntu-linux](https://gist.github.com/yusufadell/807827670087c04f2cebe36a1b835b42)

## (On Mac): After you login, click advanced and make sure that your name and email are correct. Then, click "Install Command Line Tools", just in case you want to start using the command line later in life

## Create a new repository in your GitHub application

Name it your-username.github.io
The name is very important.
Make sure the "Push to GitHub?" box is checked.

## Move your website's files into the folder that GitHub just created when you made the repository

**IMPORTANT:**
Your homepage HTML file must be called "index.html", and it must exist in the top-level directory.

## Back in the GitHub application, you should see your files in the left column. Make sure they are all checked. If so, enter a message in the text box called "commit summary", something like "initial commit." Then, click the commit button

## Click the "Publish repo" button in the top right corner

## 8-Give it about 10 minutes, then check your-

username.github.io. Your website should be there!
