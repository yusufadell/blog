# How to Learn Any Programming Language

I’m going to teach you how to learn most of the programming languages you may want to learn in
the future. This is based on how I and many other programmers learn new
languages. The process that I usually follow is as follows:

- Get a book or some introductory text about the language.

- Go through the book and type in all of the code, making all of it run.

- Read the book as you work on the code, taking notes.

- Use the language to implement a small set of programs you are familiar with in another language.

- Read other people’s code in the language, and try to copy their patterns.


In this book, I forced you to go through this process very slowly and in small chunks. Other books aren’t
organized the same way, and this means you have to extrapolate how I’ve made you do this to how their
content is organized. The best way to do this is to read the book lightly and make a list of all the major
code sections. Turn this list into a set of exercises based on the chapters, and then simply do them in
order one at a time.

The preceding process also works for new technologies, assuming they have books you can read. For
anything without books, you do the above process but use online documentation or source code as your
initial introduction.

Each new language you learn makes you a better programmer, and as you learn more languages they
become easier to learn. By your third or fourth language you should be able to pick up similar languages
in a week, with stranger languages taking longer. Now that you know Python you could potentially learn
Ruby and JavaScript fairly quickly by comparison. This is simply because many languages share similar
concepts, and once you learn the concepts in one language they work in others.

The ﬁnal thing to remember about learning a new language is this: **Don’t be a stupid tourist**. A stupid
tourist is someone who goes to another country and then complains that the food isn’t like the food at
home (“Why can’t I get a good burger in this stupid country?!”). When you’re learning a new language,
assume that what it does isn’t stupid, it’s just diﬀerent, and embrace it so you can learn it.

After you learn a language, though, don’t be a slave to that language’s way of doing things. Sometimes
the people who use a language actually do some very idiotic things for no other reason than “that’s how
we’ve always done it.” If you like your style better and you know how everyone else does it, then feel free
to break their rules if it improves things.

I really enjoy learning new programming languages. I think of myself as a “programmer anthropologist”
and think of languages as little insights about the group of programmers who use them. I’m learning a
language they all use to talk to each other through computers, and I ﬁnd this fascinating. Then again,
I’m kind of a weird guy, so just learn programming languages because you want to.

**Enjoy!**This is really fun stuﬀ.
